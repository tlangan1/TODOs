## Installation

1. To initiate this SolidJS application I executed `npx degit solidjs/templates/js TODOs`
1. A README.md was created and I renamed it to DefaultREADME.md.
1. I next executed `npm i` to install the required packages.
1. Next I executed `npm i mysql` and `npm i promise`

## Debugging

1. See D:\Computer Science\NEED TO REVIEW\Compound Debug Configuration\.vscode for a compound debug configuration.

## Configuration

1. The Express server is responding to all requests on port 3001 and should only be receiving data requests. To start this server run the following command:

   ```
   node server.js

   or

   node --inspect server.js if you wish to debug the server side
   ```

1. The SolidJS server (actually I am not sure what the server actually is) is responding to all requests on port 3000. To start the application run the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
