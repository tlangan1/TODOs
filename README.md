## Installation

1. To initiate this SolidJS application I executed `npx degit solidjs/templates/js TODOs`
1. A README.md was created and I renamed it to DefaultREADME.md.
1. I next executed `npm i` to install the required packages.
1. Next I executed `npm i mysql` and `npm i promise`

## Debugging

1. See D:\Computer Science\NEED TO REVIEW\Compound Debug Configuration\.vscode for a compound debug configuration.

## Configuration

1. The Express server is responding to all requests on port 3001 and should only be receiving data requests. To start this server run the following command:

   ```
   node server.js

   or

   node --inspect server.js if you wish to debug the server side
   ```

1. The SolidJS server (actually I am not sure what the server actually is) is responding to all requests on port 3000. To start the application run the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## TODOs

1. Rewrite fetchTODOs in a `flatter` async/await way. The README located in node_modules/mysql is very helpful.
1. Write code to handle database errors
1. If an error occurs on a fetch change the "...loading" to "unable to process this request at this time."
1. Finish code to add a TODO. See the mysql README lines 808 through 813 for a useful `insert` technique.
1. Try to create a declarative interface to writing data to the database so I do not keep rewriting the same plumbing
